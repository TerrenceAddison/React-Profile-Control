# Getting Started

Make sure to run `npm install` before anything else and setup the .env file using the .env.example file as reference.
Set the `REACT_APP_NODE_ENV` to `production` to connect with real database. Setting it to `development` will mock all api fetches.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app locally.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
